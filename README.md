# 🔢 NumPy for Data Science — Learning Notes(Hinglish language), Concepts & Mini Project

Welcome to my **NumPy learning repository**, created as part of my journey into **data science** and **data analytics**. After gaining a strong foundation in Python and building some basic projects, I moved forward to explore **NumPy**, a fundamental Python library for **numerical computing**, **array operations**, and **scientific computation**.

This repository is designed not only as my personal learning track but also as a **resource for students, professionals, or anyone beginning their data science journey** with NumPy.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Understand the core concepts of **NumPy** and its importance in **data analysis**
- Learn how **arrays, matrices, and vectors** work in numerical computing
- Explore **real-world applications** of NumPy in manipulating data
- Create a **simple image processing project** using NumPy to apply concepts practically
- Build a **resourceful set of notes and examples** for others to refer and learn from

## 🧠 Key Concepts Covered

- Creating 1D, 2D, and 3D arrays
- Array indexing, slicing, and iteration
- Reshaping and reshuffling arrays
- Mathematical operations on arrays
- Statistical functions (mean, median, std, variance)
- Vector and matrix transformations

## 📸 Mini Project: Image to Dark Mode Converter

**Project Title:** `Image Dark Mode Converter using NumPy`

In this project, I explored how images can be represented as **matrices of pixel values**, how **modifying those values** using NumPy can change the image appearance, Manipulates pixel values to simulate **dark mode** and Saves the output in `.npy` format (NumPy’s native format).

- Input: Normal image file
- Processing: Image read as a NumPy array, pixel values adjusted
- Output: Dark-themed version of the original image

> 🧠 This small project helped me understand how image data is stored in matrix format and how mathematical operations can transform it — bridging theory and practical use of **NumPy in image processing**.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **NumPy** for numerical computing and matrix operations
- **Matplotlib** (optional) for displaying image previews
- **Pillow (PIL)** for image reading and manipulation
